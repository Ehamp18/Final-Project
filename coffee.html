          <b>Here are 6 about coffee.</b>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>1. Coffee is the second most traded commodity on earth</i></b><br>
               According to the Global Exchange, there are approximately 25 million farmers in over 50 countries <br>
               involved in producing coffee. The number one commodity? Oil. </p>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>2. There are two types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta </i></b><br>
              Seventy percent of coffee beans are Arabica. Although less popular, Robusta is slightly more bitter and has twice as much caffeine.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>3. The majority of coffee is produced in Brazil </i></b><br>
              Brazil produces 40% of the world's coffee, which is twice as much as 2nd and 3rd place holders, Colombia and Vietnam.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>4. Coffee was originally a food</i></b><br>
              Coffee berries were mixed with fat to create an energy-rich snack ball. It was also consumed as a<br>
               wine when made from the pulp of coffee berries
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>5. Coffee is actually a fruit</i></b><br>
              Coffee beans as we know them are actually the pits of a cherry-like berry that are grown on bushes. <br>
              Even though coffee is actually a seed, it's called a bean because of its resemblance to actual beans
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <p> <b><i>6. This coffee beans are $500 per pound</i></b><br>
              And it comes from the feces of a Sumatran wild cat. The animal — called a Luwak — is unable to digest coffee beans.<br>
               In the process of digesting the beans, they are fermented in the stomach. When the beans are excreted, they produce a smooth, <br>
               chocolaty coffee.
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p><i>There is a picture of a Luwak and of coffe beans below.</i></p>
